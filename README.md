# PickQuest
Play through a fully detailed, immersive RPG in Minecraft- or play it safe in vanilla. Irolai is awaiting your decision.

Currently in testing, when you play PickQuest, we expect the denizens of Irolai to react and adjust to everything you do. 
This MMO has a Harvest Moon-like attention to its characters. They have complex lives, and we want you to enjoy and love (or hate) 
every one of them. 

But that's just what you come home to. At the end of the day, Pick Quest is about its world, built up in painstaking, realistic detail. 
As we work through development, expect that new regions will open up to you beyond the alpha release (which we're approaching, but aren't 
at yet). We're working to create a world that's beautiful from any angle. And we want to put something for you to find around every corner.

Heavily drawing on franchises like the Legend of Zelda and the Elder Scrolls, Pick Quest is an adventure, but it's also reflective of your own individual
experiences within the world. So stay tuned while we build and code the world for you (it's close).
